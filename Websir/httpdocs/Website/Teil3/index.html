            <h2>About Me :</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Naomi, I am 16 years old, my Myers-Briggs type is ENFP, and I was born in 2008. I am studying computer science at the IMS Bern to get my degree in economics and in information technologies, with a specialization in application development.<br>
                In my free time I do ice skating and other stuff, you can see more on this topic in the entry on the right.
                <br><br>
                My whole life, I had my siblings with me, and they are the reason why I generally like people. I am proud to say that my siblings and I have an excellent bond.<br>
                For example, we almost never fight and have active interactions, although we don't live in the same house anymore. Thanks to my father and one of my brothers, computer science is one thing I really like, and thanks to my education, I can improve my knowledge and the application of this knowledge from day to day.
                <br><br>
                Up until now, I do not know how my future will look, but one thing that is a goal of mine is joining the military in the department of Airfield soldiers. Another goal I would like to achieve in my life is traveling through several countries, but I am not quite yet ambitious about that one.
